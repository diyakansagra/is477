## data_integration Folder

This folder contains all files related to the integration of the IMDb and TMDB datasets. It includes the analysis, integration scripts (in two formats for transparency and readability), and the resulting outputs. A brief summary of each file and subfolder is provided below.

## IMDB_TMDB_Analysis.md

A comprehensive explanation of the entire integration process. This document walks through the conceptual models, schemas, matching logic, data fusion strategy, and all major decisions made while integrating the two datasets in Python.

## Week_3_IMDB_TMDB_Integration.ipynb

The Jupyter Notebook version of the integration code.

It contains brief comments explaining the logic behind each step.

More detailed explanations are reserved for the analysis document above.

## Week_3_IMDB_TMDB_Integration.py
A .py script containing the exact same code as the notebook, provided for readability and convenience for anyone who prefers reviewing scripts over notebooks.

## integration_output (Folder)

This folder contains the final results generated by the integration pipeline:

### merge_log.json

Displays transparent metrics about the integration process, including:

number of rows in each dataset

rows merged by exact match

rows matched by fuzzy logic

unmatched rows, and other summary counts

### merged_movies.csv

The final integrated dataset produced by the pipeline.

### Note: Some variables in the integrated file contain missing values.

This is expected as: 

IMDb includes fields that TMDB does not track (metascore, gross_in_millions) & TMDB includes fields IMDb does not track (popularity, vote_average_tmdb, budget_in_millions).

Even with perfect matches, these source-specific variables will naturally result in empty values in the corresponding IMDb-only or TMDB-only columns.

### Note that I will analyze these discrepancies in Week 4, as that is when we will complete our initial analysis. My main focus for Week 3 was successfully integrating the data.
