## Status Report

**Project Overview (from Project Plan):** Our project explores the relationship between movie characteristics such as genre, budget, release year, and their audience ratings and popularity. By integrating and analyzing two large movie datasets from IMDb and TMDB, we aim to identify trends that influence how well a movie performs. Our project will follow a complete data lifecycle, including acquisition, storage, cleaning, integration, analysis, and documentation, while emphasizing ethical handling, reproducibility, and transparency.

**Overview:** This status report aims to give a progress update on all of the tasks that we had detailed in our project plan, giving an updated timeline for the tasks that we have yet to complete, and an explanation of any changes we made to our project plan with the feedback that we were given.
