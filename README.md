# IS 477 Group Project Repository (Diya & Brianna)

## Movie Data Analysis Project 

This project explores the relationships between movie characteristics such as genre, budget, runtime, and release year, as well as audience reception, measured through IMDb ratings and TMDb popularity scores. By integrating datasets from IMDb and TMDb, we clean, merge, and analyze the data to identify trends that influence movie performance. The repository includes the full data workflow, from raw datasets to cleaned, integrated data, exploratory analysis, and visualizations, with an emphasis on reproducibility, transparency, and ethical data handling.
