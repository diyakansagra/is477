This folder contains the OpenRefine project files documenting the initial data exploration and cleaning process for the movie datasets. OpenRefine was used to identify inconsistencies, missing values, duplicate entries, and other potential issues in the datasets.


While no data transformations were finalized in OpenRefine, this history provides a transparent view of the data quality challenges we encountered. The actual cleaning and corrections were performed using Python scripts, which apply reproducible methods to ensure the datasets are fully prepared for integration and analysis. All scripts used to actually clean and transform the data can be found in the python_cleaning_scripts folder.


This folder serves as a reference for understanding how variables were assessed and prioritized for cleaning, supporting transparency and reproducibility in our project workflow.
