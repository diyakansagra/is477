This folder contains the data cleaning scripts and documentation for our project. Within this folder, you will find two subfolders:

OpenRefine_History – Contains OpenRefine project files that document how we explored the datasets, identified inconsistencies, and located potential issues such as missing values, duplicates, and formatting disparities. This provides a clear record of our data profiling process.


python_cleaning_scripts – Contains Python scripts used to actually clean, transform, and prepare the datasets for analysis. These scripts address the issues identified in the OpenRefine step and ensure that the data is consistent, complete, and ready for integration and further analysis.


Together, these folders provide a comprehensive, reproducible, and transparent view of the data cleaning process for our movie datasets.
