## python_cleaning_scripts Folder:

This folder contains the Python scripts used to clean and standardize the IMDb and TMDB movie datasets. These scripts were developed after inspecting the OpenRefine project files in the OpenRefine_History folder, where inconsistencies, missing values, and other data quality issues were first identified.The Python scripts resolve these disparities and produce the finalized, cleaned datasets, which are also included in this folder.

## Purpose of This Folder

Apply reproducible, programmatic data cleaning methods based on initial OpenRefine exploration.

Ensure datasets are ready for integration and analysis.

Provide clear documentation of the thought process, referencing the OpenRefine analysis.

## Contents:

## Jupyter Notebooks

## Week_2_Cleaning_IMDB_Data.ipynb & Week_2_Cleaning_TMDB_Data.ipynb

Interactive notebooks used to test and visualize outputs of each cleaning step.

Includes comments and explanations referencing OpenRefine findings to guide the cleaning process.

## Python Scripts

## Week_2_Cleaning_IMDB_Data.py & Week_2_Cleaning_TMDB_Data.py

Pure Python versions of the Jupyter notebooks.

Contain the same cleaning logic, formatted for readability and reuse in automated workflows.

## How to Use This Folder

Review the Jupyter notebooks to understand the outputs and logic behind each cleaning step.

Use the Python scripts for running the cleaning procedures in automated pipelines or production environments.

Access the cleaned datasets generated by these scripts to proceed with data integration and analysis.

Reference the OpenRefine_History folder to see the original observations that motivated each cleaning step.
