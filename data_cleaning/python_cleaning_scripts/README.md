This folder contains the Python scripts used for data cleaning. These scripts were developed in unison with inspecting the OpenRefine project, where disparities and inconsistencies in the datasets were first identified. Users can access the OpenRefine history in the OpenRefine_History folder to see how these issues were discovered. The Python scripts were then used to resolve these disparities and produce the finalized, cleaned datasets. All cleaned output files generated by these scripts can be found within this folder.
