## Week 5 — Final Visualizations & Interpretation

This folder contains all polished figures, analysis scripts, and interpretive notes for Week 5 of our IS477 project. Unlike Week 4 (EDA), which focused on initial exploration and pattern detection, Week 5 focuses on finalizing visuals and interpreting findings in a way that directly addresses our research questions:

What factors influence movie popularity and ratings?

How do IMDb ratings compare to TMDB popularity scores?

How do genre, budget, runtime, and release year interact?

## Files included:

Week_5_Final_Visualizations.ipynb — full Python analysis with polished visuals and written interpretations

Week_5_Final_Visualizations.py — script version for transparency and reproducibility

Week_5_Final_Analysis.md - full written analysis of the data in correspondance to our research questions

All plots include detailed comments explaining how they support our findings
