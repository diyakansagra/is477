##  Week 4 EDA Plots

This folder contains the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and related deliverables completed by Brianna for Week 4 of our project. It includes two versions of the same analysis to ensure transparency and accommodate different user preferences:

- `Week_4_Brianna's_EDA.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook version for interactive exploration.
- `Week_4_Brianna's_EDA.py` – Python script version for running the analysis as a script.

## What’s Inside

The files contain the analysis and visualizations that address my assigned tasks:

### Variable Analysis

   - Distribution plots for numeric variables: budget, revenue, popularity, IMDb/TMDB ratings, and runtimes.
   
   - Frequency plots for categorical variables: genres (IMDb and TMDB) and release years.
   
   - Basic descriptive statistics including mean, median, standard deviation, min/max, and missing value counts.

### Correlation Analysis
   
   - Computation of correlations among numeric variables.
  
   - Heatmap to visually highlight strong and weak relationships between variables.

### Preliminary Scatter Plots
   
   - Budget vs Revenue
   
   - IMDb Rating vs TMDB Popularity
  
   - Runtime vs IMDb Rating
  
   - Color-coded by genre to observe initial patterns and relationships.

### Missing Data & Quality Checks
   
   - Identification of missing or inconsistent values.
   
   - Notes on how missing data may be addressed during Week 5 analysis to ensure accurate and meaningful results.

## IMPORTANT Notes

These files include thorough and detailed comments that walk the reader step by step through the analysis. The comments explain what the code is doing, why each step is being performed, and how it relates to our research questions. It provides a surfae level analysis, as well as possible implications for Week 5.

Overall, this notebook provides an initial exploratory view of the data.

Week 5 will focus on deeper analysis, interpretation, and polishing visualizations.
